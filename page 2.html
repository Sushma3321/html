    you 're the one who i woudn't mind
    losing sleep for,the one who i can never get tiered of talking to and 
    crosses my mind constantly 
    through out the day. you 're the only one who can make
    me smile without trying, bring down my mood
    without the intention and effect my emotions  
    with every acting of yours. i con't explain with
    just words how much you mean to me 
    you 're the i'm afraid of losing and 
    one i want to keep in life....................</p>
